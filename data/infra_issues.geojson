They  also re-designated a few of the meters for thirty minute parking while re-designating all meters to run from 8 AM to 8 PM.  For the past two weeks we have not seen any meter readers patrolling our block.  They used to come shortly after 8 AM and they may or may not have returned later in the day.  I mention this because the other day I walked the length of our block and counted 7 cars parked in Resident Parking spots who did not have parking stickers.  I also counted 7 cars parked at expired meters, which assumes they paid for the first two hours which many drivers do not be true. Having waited years to get resident parking it is frustrating not to get access to them.  I do have one question: Are you permitted to give out tickets every two hours to the same vehicle who is in violation of parking restrictions? The reason I ask is that our block has always attracted Fenway park patrons who do not want to pay for the cost of parking lots in the area of the ball park.  The routinely arrive in the late afternoon and may or my not feed the meters.  Whether they get a ticket on not, which seldom occurs, it is still cheaper than paying $50 of more the parking lots charge.

Many residents from multiple buildings next to this project have said something to the construction workers about it, & they are dismissive rude & don't care. Just pushing the buck basically. The fire marshal that shows up for each Roadrunner venue event told me that the reason there is no parking on this street is because the street is super narrow for fire trucks. I've made the point to the construction workers that parking is free on North Beacon Street during the day time, & it is literally only 150-200FT away from where they keep parking illegally. I wouldn't begrudge their laziness if it wasn't for the fact that they are rude daily. Every single work day, 2-3 work vans are parking on the street & causing madness. Either blocking the basic high usage traffic flow on the street, or parking on the sidewalk & making it not usable for pedestrians. This project is going to go on for a LONG time. Something has to be done about this please. They're not being decent about anything they're doing. They're also parking heavy equipment at times at 35 Hichborn Street in that buildings rear parking lot, which is a private business lot. They don't have any arrangements or permissions for any of the things they're doing this way. On top of causing havoc to streets where the entire streets are essentially fire lanes.

So remember those hustlers from Foreign Auto Clinic? There is a sign saying right next to the gas station saying \"We Buy Cars!\" and you know, they do.

Only trouble is, before they push these lemons, they park them on the very only few spots of 2-hour parking and for long-long weeks. If business is not going, they spill over on to the residential. When flies are attracted to the lemons, they tend to park on the side of Wade street that is not intended for parking, making it easy to other busy little bees get in and out of the nests. All we ask is to keep your business within the legal boundaries of you parking lot (or personal driveway, would ya?) The lemons for sale have untwisted front plate and usually have a resemblance of polish unevenly applied to the tires. Occasionally lemons get tickets, but unbothered by that whatsoever. If you are the hustler reading this, be a good neighbor. Have you seen how many kids are playing on that street? Don't make it unsafe. Let their friends and family come for a play date and park for 2 hours. If you are looking to buy one of the lemons, do it ASAP, we need some parking ova heah! If you a parking enforcer - please, issue a warning to this business establishment. Tickets do nothing for them, I wish it was the same for some random students who are stranded without residential parking and get a ticket for staying over half an hour.
